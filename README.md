# flutter-image-asset-tool 

A simple [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension(Base on extension [Flutter Image Asset Generator](https://github.com/devmuaz/flutter-image-assets)) which helps you generate your image assets from 3x to 1x, 2x. And rename your image before add to your assets folder.

In China, we usually generate 1x and 3x image from 3x. such as "ËìùÊπñ". That is the part different from extension [Flutter Image Asset Generator](https://github.com/devmuaz/flutter-image-assets)).

## Usage

1. After installing the extension, you should see a new option has been added your context menu when you right click on any folder inside the `Explorer` section named `Flutter-image-asset-tool: Add Image`:

2. Click on it and select the image you want to add.. after that, the selected image will be choosen.

3.  Modify Image name in the InputBox, and click confirm to the name of image.It will scaled down to 1x, 2x in seprated directories.

## Known Issues

Currently, this extension only generates the scaled images.. but not adding them to the `pubspec.yaml` file so you have to add them yourself.
